Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was an online project that was made for people to get theri drivers tests done and pass the driving portion. The client was a business owner who wanted to improve the way driving tests were passed. The design was to make a place customers could schedule and make appointments and others could use that data to do their jobs.  

What did you do particularly well?
I felt I was able to produce a good design for the system. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve on the security portion of the business requirement. Giving more attention to security will keep the project able to keep going. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs implemented in the design is crucial. That is the main point of creating a product and is the guide to how to complete the design. I made sure to think of all aspects when making the design, such as how will the user see the site when making an appointment. How should the post information be sent for confirmation. What happens if an appointment isnt avaiable at the time of request. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think of software design as a flow of information that needs to be handled. First I need to have an idea, the nhow to implement the idea, how will this software be used and lastly what must it accomplish. Then after that I create the software to accomplish the needs.
